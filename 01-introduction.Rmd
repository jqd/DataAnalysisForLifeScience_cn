```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
In this book we will be using the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/) for all our analysis. You will learn R and statistics simultaneously. However, we assume you have some basic programming skills and knowledge of R syntax. If you don't, your first homework, listed below, is to complete a tutorial. Here we give step-by-step instructions on how to get set up to follow along. 
```

&emsp;&emsp;本书中我们的所有数据分析将基于[R语言](https://cran.r-project.org/)。 你在学习R语言的同时也将学习统计学。但是我们假设你已经具有一定的编程基础并且了解R语言基本语法。如果你尚不具备这些知识，我们建议你完成下面的教程。我们将手把手一步一步的教你建立和熟悉R环境。

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
## Installing R
```

## 安装R
```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
The first step is to install R. You can download and install R from
the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)
(CRAN). It is relatively straightforward, but if you need further help
you can try the following resources: 

* [Installing R on Windows](https://github.com/genomicsclass/windows#installing-r) 
* [Installing R on Mac](http://youtu.be/Icawuhf0Yqo)
* [Installing R on Ubuntu](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README)
```

&emsp;&emsp;第一步是R的安装。你可以从[Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)（CRAN）免费下载和安装R。R的安装很简单，如果你需要帮助，请参考以下的安装说明：
* [Windows环境下R的安装](https://github.com/genomicsclass/windows#installing-r)
* [Mac环境下R的安装](http://youtu.be/Icawuhf0Yqo)
* [Ubuntu环境下R的安装](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README)

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
## Installing RStudio
```
## 安装RStudio
```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
The next step is to install RStudio, a program for viewing and running
R scripts. Technically you can run all the code shown here without
installing RStudio, but we highly recommend this integrated
development environment (IDE). Instructions are
[here](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and for
Windows we have special
[instructions](https://github.com/genomicsclass/windows). 
```
&emsp;&emsp;下一步是RStudio的安装。RStudio是目前R语言最好的集成开发环境（Integrated
Development Environment，IDE），可以用来编辑和运行代码。你无需安装RStudio就可以运行本书中所有的代码，但是我们强烈推荐你安装Rstudio。RStudio的安装程序可以在[此处](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)下载。windows用户可以参考我们的详细[安装说明](https://github.com/genomicsclass/windows)。


```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
## Learn R Basics
```
## R语言基础入门
```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
The first homework assignment is to complete an R tutorial to
familiarize yourself with the basics of programming and R syntax. 
To follow this book you should be familiar with the difference between lists (including data frames) and numeric vectors, for-loops, how to create functions, and how to use the `sapply` and `replicate` functions. 
```
&emsp;&emsp;第一个作业是通过完成一个R教程来熟悉编程基础和R语言的基本语法。你应该熟悉列表（包括数据框）和数字向量之间的不同，for循环，如何创建函数，以及如何使用‘sapply’和‘replicate’函数。


```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
If you are already familiar with R, you can skip to the next section. Otherwise, you should go through the [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) tutorial, which teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace and in the R console. Once you have R installed, you can install `swirl` and run it the following way: 
```
&emsp;&emsp;如果你已经熟悉R语言，你可以直接跳到下一节。否则，你应该以自己的步调在R控制台中完成[swirl](http://swirlstats.com/)教程，它通过交互方式教你R编程和数据科学。一旦你安装了R，你就可以按以下方式安装和运行‘swirl’：

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
swirl()
```

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
Alternatively you can take the [try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) interactive class from Code School.
There are also many open and free resources and reference
guides for R. Two examples are:

* [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/): a quick online reference for data input, basic statistics and plots
* R reference card (PDF)[https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf] by Tom Short 
```
&emsp;&emsp;或者，你可以参加Code School的[尝试R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/)互动课程。除此之外，还有许多开放和免费的资源和参考资料。
比如下面的两个例子：
* [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)：R数据输入，基本统计和图表的快速在线参考
* [R参考卡片(PDF)][https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf] Tom Short 著

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
Two key things you need to know about R is that you can get help for a function using `help` or `?`, like this:
```
&emsp;&emsp;你需要知道的关于R的两个关键的事情是你可以使用‘help’或‘?’来获得函数的帮助，如下所示：

```{r,eval=FALSE}
?install.packages
help("install.packages")
```

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
and the hash character represents comments, so text following these
characters is not interpreted:
```
&emsp;&emsp;而‘#’字符代表注释，所以‘#’字符以后的文字将不被执行：

```{r}
##This is just a comment
```

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
## Installing Packages
```
## 包的安装
```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
The first R command we will run is `install.packages`. If you took the
`swirl` tutorial you should have already done this. R only includes a basic set of
functions. It can do much more than this, but not everybody needs
everything so we instead make some functions available via
packages. Many of these functions are stored in CRAN. Note that these
packages are vetted: they are checked for common errors and they must have
a dedicated maintainer. You can easily install packages from within R if you know
the name of the packages. As an example, we are going to install the
package `rafalib` which we use in our first data
analysis examples: 
```
&emsp;&emsp;我们要运行的第一个R命令是‘install.packages’。如果你完成了‘swirl’教程，你应该已经学习了这个命令。由于不是每个人都需要所有的包，R默认仅安装基本的包。用户可以根据自己的需要，选择和安装不同功能的包来扩展R的功能。这些包通常都存储在[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)，而且已经被审查过是否有常见的错误，是否有一个专门的维护者。如果你知道你要安装的包的名字，那么安装将非常简单。你只需要在R里运行‘install.packages’命令即可。比如安装这个我们将在第一个数据分析例子中使用的‘rafalib’包：

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rafalib")
```

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
We can then load the package into our R sessions using the `library` function:
```
&emsp;&emsp;然后我们就可以使用‘library’函数将这个包加载到当前的R会话中使用。
```{r}
library(rafalib)
```

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
From now on you will see that we sometimes load packages without
installing them. This is because once you install the package, it
remains in place and only needs to be loaded with `library`. If you
try to load a package and get an error, it probably means you need to
install it first.
```

&emsp;&emsp;从现在开始，你会发现我们有时直接加载包而不需要安装它们。这是因为一旦你安装了包，它依然存在。下次使用时，你只需要用‘library’函数加载它即可。如果加载包时遇到错误，你可能需要先安装它。

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
## Importing Data into R
```
## 数据的导入

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
The first step when preparing to analyze data is to read in the data into R. There are several ways to do this and we will discuss three of them. But you only need to learn one to follow along. 
```
&emsp;&emsp;数据分析的第一步是将数据导入R。数据导入的方法有很多，这里我们将介绍其中的三种。但是学会其中一个就可以跟随本书学习。

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
In the life sciences, small datasets such as the one used as an
example in the next sections are typically stored as Excel files. Although there
are R packages designed to read Excel (xls) format, you generally want
to avoid this and save files as comma delimited (Comma-Separated
Value/CSV) or tab delimited (Tab-Separated Value/TSV/TXT) files.
These plain-text formats are often easier for sharing data with
collaborators, as commercial software is not required for viewing or
working with the data.
```
&emsp;&emsp;在生命科学中，小数据集，比如下一节用到的示例数据，通常以excel文件格式存储。尽管有专门读取Excel（xls）格式的R包，通常你需要避免存储为excel文件, 而应该保存为以逗号（csv）或者制表符（TSV/TXT）为分割符的文件。因为不需要安装专门的商业软件，这些纯文本文件通常更便于与合作者共享数据。

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
We will start with a simple example dataset containing
[female mouse weights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/femaleMiceWeights.csv).
```
&emsp;&emsp;我们将从一个简单的数据开始。这是一个含有[母老鼠体重](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/femaleMiceWeights.csv)的数据集。

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
The first step is to find the file containing your data and know its *path*. 
```
&emsp;&emsp;第一步是找到你要分析的数据文件和它在你电脑上的存储*路径*。

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
#### Paths and the Working Directory
```

#### 路径和工作目录

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
When you are working in R it is useful to know your _working directory_. This is the directory or folder in which R will save or look for files by default. You can see your working directory by typing:
```
&emsp;&emsp;当你用R分析数据时，知道你的_工作目录_是很有用的。R默认将文件保存在此目录或者从该目录查找文件。你可以通过输入如下的命令来获取你的工作目录：

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```
```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
You can also change your working directory using the function `setwd`. Or you can change it through RStudio by clicking on "Session". 
```

&emsp;&emsp;改变工作目录，你需要使用‘setwd’函数或者通过RStudio里的‘会话’菜单来更改。

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
The functions that read and write files (there are several in R) assume you mean to look for files or write files in the working directory. Our recommended approach for beginners will have you reading and writing to the working directory. However, you can also type the [full path](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/absopath.htm), which will work independently of the working directory.
```
&emsp;&emsp;R语言中有几个在当前工作目录中查找和写入文件的函数。尽管你可以通过输入[完整路径](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/absopath.htm)来取和写入文件，我们推荐初学者在当前工作目录下操作。

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
#### Projects in RStudio
```

#### RStudio中的项目

```{{block2 echo = FALSE}}
We find that the simplest way to organize yourself is to start a Project in RStudio (Click on "File" and "New Project"). When creating the project, you will select a folder to be associated with it. You can then download all your data into this folder. Your working directory will be this folder.
```
&emsp;&emsp;

#### Option 1: Read file over the Internet
You can navigate to the `femaleMiceWeights.csv` file by visiting the
data directory of dagdata on
[GitHub](https://github.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/tree/master/inst/extdata). If you navigate to the file, you need to click on *Raw* on the
upper right hand corner of the page. 

![GitHub page screenshot.](images/handmade/screenshot1.png)

Now you can copy and paste the URL and use this as the argument to `read.csv`.
Here we break the URL into a base directory and a filename and then combine
with `paste0` because the URL would otherwise be too long for the page.
We use `paste0` because we want to put the strings together as is, if you were
specifying a file on your machine you should use the smarter function, `file.path`,
which knows the difference between Windows and Mac file path connectors.
You can specify the URL using a single string to avoid this extra step.

```{r,message=FALSE}
dir <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/"
url <- paste0(dir, "femaleMiceWeights.csv")
dat <- read.csv(url)
```

#### Option 2: Download file with your browser to your working directory

There are reasons for wanting to keep a local copy of the file. For example, you may want to run the analysis while not connected to the Internet or you may want to ensure reproducibility regardless of the file being available on the original site. To download the file, as in option 1, you can navigate to the `femaleMiceWeights.csv`. In this option we use your browser's "Save
As" function to ensure that the downloaded file is in a CSV
format. Some browsers add an extra suffix to your filename by
default. You do not want this. You want your file to be named
`femaleMiceWeights.csv`. Once you have this file in your working directory, then you can simply read it in like this:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
dat <- read.csv("femaleMiceWeights.csv")
```

If you did not receive any message, then you probably read in the file successfully.

#### Option 3: Download the file from within R

We store many of the datasets used here on [GitHub](https://github.com/genomicsclass/). You can save these files directly from the Internet to your computer using R. In this example, we are using the `download.file` function in the `downloader` package to download the file to a specific location and then read it in. We can assign it a random name and a random directory using the function `tempfile`, but you can also save it in directory with the name of your choosing.

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(downloader) ##use install.packages to install
dir <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/"
filename <- "femaleMiceWeights.csv" 
url <- paste0(dir, filename)
if (!file.exists(filename)) download(url, destfile=filename)
```

We can then proceed as in option 2:
```{r}
dat <- read.csv(filename)
```

#### Option 4: Download the data package (Advanced)

Many of the datasets we include in this book are available in custom-built packages from GitHub. The reason we use GitHub, rather than CRAN, is that on GitHub we do not have to vet packages, which gives us much more flexibility. 

To install packages from GitHub you will need to install the `devtools` package:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Note to Windows users: to use devtools you will have to also install `Rtools`. In general you will need to install packages as administrator. One way to do this is to start R as administrator. If you do not have permission to do this, then it is a bit [more complicated](http://www.magesblog.com/2012/04/installing-r-packages-without-admin.html). 

Now you are ready to install a package from GitHub. For this we use a different function:

```{r,message=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("genomicsclass/dagdata")
```

The file we are working with is actually included in this package. Once you install the package, the file is on your computer. However, finding it requires advanced knowledge. Here are the lines of code:

```{r}
dir <- system.file(package="dagdata") #extracts the location of package
list.files(dir)
list.files(file.path(dir,"extdata")) #external data is in this directory
```

And now we are ready to read in the file:

```{r}
filename <- file.path(dir,"extdata/femaleMiceWeights.csv")
dat <- read.csv(filename)
```

### Getting Started Exercises

__Exercises__

Here we will test some of the basics of R data manipulation which you should know or should have learned by following the tutorials above. You will need to have the file `femaleMiceWeights.csv` in your working directory. As we showed above, one way to do this is by using the `downloader` package:

```
library(downloader) 
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/femaleMiceWeights.csv"
filename <- "femaleMiceWeights.csv" 
download(url, destfile=filename)
```

1. Read in the `file femaleMiceWeights.csv` and report the body weight of the mouse in the exact name of the column containing the weights.

2. The `[` and `]` symbols can be used to extract specific rows and specific columns of the table. What is the entry in the 12th row and second column?

3. You should have learned how to use the `$` character to extract a column from a table and return it as a vector. Use `$` to extract the weight column and report the weight of the mouse in the 11th row.

4. The length function returns the number of elements in a vector. How many mice are included in our dataset?



5. To create a vector with the numbers 3 to 7, we can use seq(3,7) or, because they are consecutive, 3:7. View the data and determine what rows are associated with the high fat or hf diet. Then use the mean function to compute the average weight of these mice.

6. One of the functions we will be using often is sample. Read the help file for sample using ?sample. Now take a random sample of size 1 from the numbers 13 to 24 and report back the weight of the mouse represented by that row. Make sure to type set.seed(1) to ensure that everybody gets the same answer.





## Brief Introduction to `dplyr`

The learning curve for R syntax is slow. One of the more difficult aspects that requires some getting used to is subsetting data tables. The `dplyr` package brings these tasks closer to English and we are therefore going to introduce two simple functions: one is used to subset and the other to select columns.

Take a look at the dataset we read in:
```{r}
filename <- "femaleMiceWeights.csv"
dat <- read.csv(filename)
head(dat) #In R Studio use View(dat)
```

There are two types of diets, which are denoted in the first column. If we want just the weights, we only need the second column. So if we want the weights for mice on the `chow` diet, we subset and filter like this:

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr) 
chow <- filter(dat, Diet=="chow") #keep only the ones with chow diet
head(chow)
```

And now we can select only the column with the values:

```{r}
chowVals <- select(chow,Bodyweight)
head(chowVals)
```

A nice feature of the `dplyr` package is that you can perform consecutive tasks by using what is called a "pipe". In `dplyr` we use `%>%` to denote a pipe. This symbol tells the program to first do one thing and then do something else to the result of the first. Hence, we can perform several data manipulations in one line. For example:

```{r}
chowVals <- filter(dat, Diet=="chow") %>% select(Bodyweight)
```

In the second task, we no longer have to specify the object we are editing since it is whatever comes from the previous call. 

Also, note that if `dplyr` receives a `data.frame` it will return a `data.frame`. 
```{r}
class(dat)
class(chowVals)
```

For pedagogical reasons, we will often want the final result to be a simple `numeric` vector. To obtain such a vector with `dplyr`, we can apply the `unlist` function which turns `lists`, such as `data.frames`, into `numeric` vectors:

```{r}
chowVals <- filter(dat, Diet=="chow") %>% select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
class( chowVals )
```


To do this in R without `dplyr` the code is the following:

```{r}
chowVals <- dat[ dat$Diet=="chow", colnames(dat)=="Bodyweight"]
```


### `dplyr` exercises

__Exercises__

For these exercises, we will use a new dataset related to mammalian sleep. This data is described [here](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/msleep.html). Download the CSV file from this location:

We are going to read in this data, then test your knowledge of they key `dplyr` functions `select` and `filter`. We are also going to review two different classes: data frames and vectors.

1. Read in the `msleep_ggplot2.csv` file with the function `read.csv` and use the function `class` to determine what type of object is returned.

2. Now use the `filter` function to select only the primates. How many animals in the table are primates? Hint: the nrow function gives you the number of rows of a data frame or matrix.

3. What is the class of the object you obtain after subsetting the table to only include primates?

4. Now use the `select` function to extract the sleep (total) for the primates. What class is this object? Hint: use `%>%` to pipe the results of the `filter` function to `select`.

5. Now we want to calculate the average amount of sleep for primates (the average of the numbers computed above). One challenge is that the `mean` function requires a vector so, if we simply apply it to the output above, we get an error. Look at the help file for `unlist` and use it to compute the desired average.

6. For the last exercise, we could also use the dplyr `summarize` function. We have not introduced this function, but you can read the help file and repeat exercise 5, this time using just `filter` and `summarize` to get the answer.


## Mathematical Notation

This book focuses on teaching statistical concepts and data analysis programming skills. We avoid mathematical notation as much as possible, but we do use it.  We do not want readers to be intimidated by the notation though. Mathematics is actually the easier part of learning statistics. Unfortunately, many text books use mathematical notation in what we believe to be an over-complicated way. For this reason, we do try to keep the notation as simple as possible. However, we do not want to water down the material, and some mathematical notation facilitates a deeper understanding of the concepts. Here we describe a few specific symbols that we use often. If they appear intimidating to you, please take some time to read this section carefully as they are actually simpler than they seem. Because by now you should be somewhat familiar with R, we will make the connection between mathematical notation and R code.


#### Indexing

Those of us dealing with data almost always have a series of numbers. To describe the concepts in an abstract way, we use indexing. For example 5 numbers:

```{r}
x <- 1:5
```

can be generally represented like this $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$. We use dots to simplify this $x_1,\dots,x_5$ and indexing to simplify even more $x_i, i=1,\dots,5$. If we want to describe a procedure for a list of any size $n$, we write $x_i, i=1,\dots,n$. 

We sometimes have two indexes. For example, we may have several measurements (blood pressure, weight, height, age, cholesterol level) for 100 individuals. We can then use double indexes: $x_{i,j}, i=1,\dots,100, j=1,\dots,5$. 


#### Summation

A very common operation in data analysis is to sum several numbers. This comes up, for example, when we compute averages and standard deviations. If we have many numbers, there is a mathematical notation that makes it quite easy to express the following:

```{r}
n <- 1000
x <- 1:n
S <- sum(x)
```

and it is the $\sum$ notation (capital S in Greek):

$$
S = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
$$

Note that we make use of indexing as well. We will see that what is included inside the summation can become quite complicated. However, the summation part should not confuse you as it is a simple operation.

#### Greek letters

We would prefer to avoid Greek letters, but they are ubiquitous in the statistical literature so we want you to become used to them. They are mainly used to distinguish the unknown from the observed. Suppose we want to find out the average height of a population and we take a sample of 1,000 people to estimate this. The unknown average we want to estimate is often denoted with $\mu$, the Greek letter for m (m is for mean). The standard deviation is often denoted with $\sigma$, the Greek letter for s. Measurement error or other unexplained random variability is typically denoted with $\varepsilon$, the Greek letter for e. Effect sizes, for example the effect of a diet on weight, are typically denoted with $\beta$. We may use other Greek letters but those are the most commonly used. 

You should get used to these four Greek letters as you will be seeing them often: $\mu$, $\sigma$, $\beta$ and $\varepsilon$. 

Note that indexing is sometimes used in conjunction with Greek letters to denote different groups. For example, if we have one set of numbers denoted with $x$ and another with $y$ we may use $\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$ to denote their averages.

#### Infinity

In the text we often talk about _asymptotic_ results. Typically, this refers to an approximation that gets better and better as the number of data points we consider gets larger and larger, with perfect approximations occurring when the number of data points is $\infty$. In practice, there is no such thing as $\infty$, but it is a convenient concept to understand. One way to think about asymptotic results is as results that become better and better as some number increases and we can pick a number so that a computer can't tell the difference between the approximation and the real number. Here is a very simple example that approximates 1/3 with decimals:

```{r}
onethird <- function(n) sum( 3/10^c(1:n))
1/3 - onethird(4)
1/3 - onethird(10)
1/3 - onethird(16)
```

In the example above, 16 is practically $\infty$.




#### Integrals

We only use these a couple of times so you can skip this section if you prefer. However, integrals are actually much simpler to understand than perhaps you realize. 

For certain statistical operations, we need to figure out areas under the curve. For example, for a function $f(x)$ ... 

```{r intergrals, fig.cap="Integral of a function.",echo=FALSE}
f <- dnorm
x <- seq(-4,4,length=100)
plot(x, f(x), type="l")
x0 <- x[x>2]
y0 <- f(x0)
x0 <- c(min(x0),x0,max(x0))
y0 <- c(0,y0,0)
polygon(x0,y0,col="grey")
```

...we need to know what proportion of the total area under the curve is grey. 

The grey area can be thought of as many small grey bars stacked next to each other. The area is then just the sum of the areas of these little bars. The problem is that we can't do this for every number between 2 and 4 because there are an infinite number. The integral is the mathematical solution to this problem. In this case, the total area is 1 so the answer to what proportion is grey is the following integral:

$$
\int_2^4 f(x) \, dx
$$

Because we constructed this example, we know that the grey area is 2.27% of the total. Note that this is very well approximated by an actual sum of little bars:

```{r}
width <- 0.01
x <- seq(2,4,width)
areaofbars <-  f(x)*width
sum( areaofbars )
```

The smaller we make `width`, the closer the sum gets to the integral, which is equal to the area.

In this book we try to minimize mathematical notation as much as possible. Furthermore, we avoid using calculus to motivate statistical concepts. However, Matrix Algebra (also referred to as Linear Algebra) and its mathematical notation greatly facilitates the exposition of the advanced data analysis techniques covered in the remainder of this book. We therefore dedicate a chapter of this book to introducing Matrix Algebra. We do this in the context of data analysis and using one of the main applications: Linear Models.

We will describe three examples from the life sciences: one from physics, one related to genetics, and one from a mouse experiment. They are very different, yet we end up using the same statistical technique: fitting linear models. Linear models are typically taught and described in the language of matrix algebra.

## Motivating Examples

#### Falling objects

Imagine you are Galileo in the 16th century trying to describe the velocity of a falling object. An assistant climbs the Tower of Pisa and drops a ball, while several other assistants record the position at different times. Let's simulate some data using the equations we know today and adding some measurement error:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
g <- 9.8 ##meters per second
n <- 25
tt <- seq(0,3.4,len=n) ##time in secs, note: we use tt because t is a base function
d <- 56.67  - 0.5*g*tt^2 + rnorm(n,sd=1) ##meters
```

The assistants hand the data to Galileo and this is what he sees:

```{r gravity, fig.cap="Simulated data for distance travelled versus time of falling object measured with error."}
mypar()
plot(tt,d,ylab="Distance in meters",xlab="Time in seconds")
```

He does not know the exact equation, but by looking at the plot above he deduces that the position should follow a parabola. So he models the data with:

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \varepsilon_i, i=1,\dots,n $$

With $Y_i$ representing location, $x_i$ representing the time, and $\varepsilon_i$ accounting for measurement error. This is a linear model because it is a linear combination of known quantities (the $x$'s) referred to as predictors or covariates and unknown parameters (the $\beta$'s).

#### Father & son heights
Now imagine you are Francis Galton in the 19th century and you collect paired height data from fathers and sons. You suspect that height is inherited. Your data:

```{r,message=FALSE}
data(father.son,package="UsingR")
x=father.son$fheight
y=father.son$sheight
```

looks like this:

```{r galton_data, fig.cap="Galton's data. Son heights versus father heights."}
plot(x,y,xlab="Father's height",ylab="Son's height")
```

The sons' heights do seem to increase linearly with the fathers' heights. In this case, a model that describes the data is as follows:

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i, i=1,\dots,N $$

This is also a linear model with $x_i$ and $Y_i$, the father and son heights respectively, for the $i$-th pair and $\varepsilon_i$ a term to account for the extra variability. Here we think of the fathers' heights as the predictor and being fixed (not random) so we use lower case. Measurement error alone can't explain all the variability seen in $\varepsilon_i$. This makes sense as there are other variables not in the model, for example, mothers' heights, genetic randomness, and environmental factors.

#### Random samples from multiple populations

Here we read-in mouse body weight data from mice that were fed two different diets: high fat and control (chow). We have a random sample of 12 mice for each. We are interested in determining if the diet has an effect on weight. Here is the data:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(downloader)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/femaleMiceWeights.csv"
filename <- "femaleMiceWeights.csv"
if (!file.exists(filename)) download(url,destfile=filename)
```

```{r mice_weights,fig.cap="Mouse weights under two diets."}
dat <- read.csv("femaleMiceWeights.csv")
mypar(1,1)
stripchart(Bodyweight~Diet,data=dat,vertical=TRUE,method="jitter",pch=1,main="Mice weights")
```

We want to estimate the difference in average weight between populations. We demonstrated how to do this using t-tests and confidence intervals, based on the difference in sample averages. We can obtain the same exact results using a linear model:

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \varepsilon_i$$

with $\beta_0$ the chow diet average weight, $\beta_1$ the difference between averages, $x_i = 1$ when mouse $i$ gets the high fat (hf) diet, $x_i = 0$ when it gets the chow diet, and $\varepsilon_i$ explains the differences between mice of the same population. 
 

#### Linear models in general

We have seen three very different examples in which linear models can be used. A general model that encompasses all of the above examples is the following:

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i,1} + \beta_2 x_{i,2} + \dots +  \beta_2 x_{i,p} + \varepsilon_i, i=1,\dots,n $$

 
$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_{i,j} + \varepsilon_i, i=1,\dots,n $$

Note that we have a general number of predictors $p$. Matrix algebra provides a compact language and mathematical framework to compute and make derivations with any linear model that fits into the above framework.

#### Estimating parameters

For the models above to be useful we have to estimate the unknown $\beta$ s. In the first example, we want to describe a physical process for which we can't have unknown parameters. In the second example, we better understand inheritance by estimating how much, on average, the father's height affects the son's height. In the final example, we want to determine if there is in fact a difference: if $\beta_1 \neq 0$. 

The standard approach in science is to find the values that minimize the distance of the fitted model to the data. The following is called the least squares (LS) equation and we will see it often in this chapter:

$$ \sum_{i=1}^n \left\{  Y_i - \left(\beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_{i,j}\right)\right\}^2 $$

Once we find the minimum, we will call the values the least squares estimates (LSE) and denote them with $\hat{\beta}$. The quantity obtained when evaluating the least squares equation at the estimates is called the residual sum of squares (RSS). Since all these quantities depend on $Y$, *they are random variables*. The $\hat{\beta}$ s are random variables and we will eventually perform inference on them.

#### Falling object example revisited
Thanks to my high school physics teacher, I know that the equation for the trajectory of a falling object is: 

$$d = h_0 + v_0 t -  0.5 \times 9.8 t^2$$

with $h_0$ and $v_0$ the starting height and velocity respectively. The data we simulated above followed this equation and added measurement error to simulate `n` observations for dropping the ball $(v_0=0)$ from the tower of Pisa $(h_0=56.67)$. This is why we used this code to simulate data:

```{r simulate_drop_data}
g <- 9.8 ##meters per second
n <- 25
tt <- seq(0,3.4,len=n) ##time in secs, t is a base function
f <- 56.67  - 0.5*g*tt^2
y <-  f + rnorm(n,sd=1)
```

Here is what the data looks like with the solid line representing the true trajectory:

```{r simulate_drop_data_with_fit, fig.cap="Fitted model for simulated data for distance travelled versus time of falling object measured with error."}
plot(tt,y,ylab="Distance in meters",xlab="Time in seconds")
lines(tt,f,col=2)
```

But we were pretending to be Galileo and so we don't know the parameters in the model. The data does suggest it is a parabola, so we model it as such:

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \varepsilon_i, i=1,\dots,n $$

How do we find the LSE?

#### The `lm` function

In R we can fit this model by simply using the `lm` function. We will describe this function in detail later, but here is a preview:

```{r}
tt2 <-tt^2
fit <- lm(y~tt+tt2)
summary(fit)$coef
```

It gives us the LSE, as well as standard errors and p-values. 

Part of what we do in this section is to explain the mathematics behind this function. 

#### The least squares estimate (LSE)

Let's write a function that computes the RSS for any vector $\beta$:
```{r}
rss <- function(Beta0,Beta1,Beta2){
  r <- y - (Beta0+Beta1*tt+Beta2*tt^2)
  return(sum(r^2))
}
```

So for any three dimensional vector we get an RSS. Here is a plot of the RSS as a function of $\beta_2$ when we keep the other two fixed:

```{r rss_versus_estimate, fig.cap="Residual sum of squares obtained for several values of the parameters."}
Beta2s<- seq(-10,0,len=100)
plot(Beta2s,sapply(Beta2s,rss,Beta0=55,Beta1=0),
     ylab="RSS",xlab="Beta2",type="l")
##Let's add another curve fixing another pair:
Beta2s<- seq(-10,0,len=100)
lines(Beta2s,sapply(Beta2s,rss,Beta0=65,Beta1=0),col=2)
```

Trial and error here is not going to work. Instead, we can use calculus: take the partial derivatives, set them to 0 and solve. Of course, if we have many parameters, these equations can get rather complex. Linear algebra provides a compact and general way of solving this problem. 


#### More on Galton (Advanced)

When studying the father-son data, Galton made a fascinating discovery using exploratory analysis.

![Galton's plot.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Galton's_correlation_diagram_1875.jpg) 

He noted that if he tabulated the number of father-son height pairs and followed all the x,y values having the same totals in the table, they formed an ellipse. In the plot above, made by Galton, you see the ellipse formed by the pairs having 3 cases. This then led to modeling this data as correlated bivariate normal which we described earlier: 

$$ 
Pr(X<a,Y<b) =
$$


$$
\int_{-\infty}^{a} \int_{-\infty}^{b} \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma_x\sigma_y\sqrt{1-\rho^2}}
\exp{ \left\{
\frac{1}{2(1-\rho^2)}
\left[\left(\frac{x-\mu_x}{\sigma_x}\right)^2 -  
2\rho\left(\frac{x-\mu_x}{\sigma_x}\right)\left(\frac{y-\mu_y}{\sigma_y}\right)+
\left(\frac{y-\mu_y}{\sigma_y}\right)^2
\right]
\right\}
}
$$

We described how we can use math to show that if you keep $X$ fixed (condition to be $x$) the distribution of $Y$ is normally distributed with mean: $\mu_x +\sigma_y \rho \left(\frac{x-\mu_x}{\sigma_x}\right)$ and standard deviation $\sigma_y \sqrt{1-\rho^2}$. Note that $\rho$ is the correlation between $Y$ and $X$, which implies that if we fix $X=x$, $Y$ does in fact follow a linear model. The $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ parameters in our simple linear model can be expressed in terms of $\mu_x,\mu_y,\sigma_x,\sigma_y$, and $\rho$.


## Matrix Notation

Here we introduce the basics of matrix notation. Initially this may seem over-complicated, but once we discuss examples, you will appreciate the power of using this notation to both explain and derive solutions, as well as implement them as R code. 

#### The language of linear models

Linear algebra notation actually simplifies the mathematical descriptions and manipulations of linear models, as well as coding in R. We will discuss the basics of this notation and then show some examples in R.

The main point of this entire exercise is to show how we can write the models above using matrix notation, and then explain how this is useful for solving the least squares equation. We start by simply defining notation and matrix multiplication, but bear with us since we eventually get back to the practical application.

## Solving Systems of Equations

Linear algebra was created by mathematicians to solve systems of linear equations such as this:

$$
\begin{align*}
a + b + c &= 6\\
3a - 2b + c &= 2\\
2a + b  - c &= 1
\end{align*}
$$

It provides very useful machinery to solve these problems generally. We will learn how we can write and solve this system using matrix algebra notation:

$$ 
\,
\begin{pmatrix}
1&1&1\\
3&-2&1\\
2&1&-1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a\\
b\\
c
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
6\\
2\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
\implies
\begin{pmatrix}
a\\
b\\
c
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
1&1&1\\
3&-2&1\\
2&1&-1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{pmatrix}
6\\
2\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This section explains the notation used above. It turns out that we can borrow this notation for linear models in statistics as well.

## Vectors, Matrices, and Scalars

In the falling object, father-son heights, and mouse weight examples, the random variables associated with the data were represented by $Y_1,\dots,Y_n$. We can think of this as a vector. In fact, in R we are already doing this:

```{r,message=FALSE}
data(father.son,package="UsingR")
y=father.son$fheight
head(y)
```
In math we can also use just one symbol. We usually use bold to distinguish it from the individual entries:

$$ \mathbf{Y} = \begin{pmatrix}
Y_1\\\
Y_2\\\
\vdots\\\
Y_N
\end{pmatrix}
$$


For reasons that will soon become clear, default representation of data vectors have dimension $N\times 1$ as opposed to $1 \times N$ .

Here we don't always use bold because normally one can tell what is a matrix from the context.

Similarly, we can use math notation to represent the covariates or predictors. In a case with two predictors we can represent them like this:

$$ 
\mathbf{X}_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
x_{1,1}\\
\vdots\\
x_{N,1}
\end{pmatrix} \mbox{ and }
\mathbf{X}_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
x_{1,2}\\
\vdots\\
x_{N,2}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Note that for the falling object example $x_{1,1}= t_i$ and $x_{i,1}=t_i^2$ with $t_i$ the time of the i-th observation. Also, keep in mind that vectors can be thought of as $N\times 1$ matrices.

For reasons that will soon become apparent, it is convenient to represent these in matrices:

$$ 
\mathbf{X} = [ \mathbf{X}_1 \mathbf{X}_2 ] = \begin{pmatrix}
x_{1,1}&x_{1,2}\\
\vdots\\
x_{N,1}&x_{N,2}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This matrix has dimension $N \times 2$. We can create this matrix in R this way:

```{r}
n <- 25
tt <- seq(0,3.4,len=n) ##time in secs, t is a base function
X <- cbind(X1=tt,X2=tt^2)
head(X)
dim(X)
```

We can also use this notation to denote an arbitrary number of covariates with the following $N\times p$ matrix:

$$
\mathbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix}
  x_{1,1}&\dots & x_{1,p} \\
  x_{2,1}&\dots & x_{2,p} \\
   & \vdots & \\
  x_{N,1}&\dots & x_{N,p} 
  \end{pmatrix}
$$

Just as an example, we show you how to make one in R now using `matrix` instead of `cbind`:

```{r}
N <- 100; p <- 5
X <- matrix(1:(N*p),N,p)
head(X)
dim(X)
```

By default, the matrices are filled column by column. The `byrow=TRUE` argument lets us change that to row by row:

```{r}
N <- 100; p <- 5
X <- matrix(1:(N*p),N,p,byrow=TRUE)
head(X)
```

Finally, we define a scalar. A scalar is just a number, which we call a scalar because we want to distinguish it from vectors and matrices. We usually use lower case and don't bold. In the next section, we will understand why we make this distinction.

## Matrix Operations

In a previous section, we motivated the use of matrix algebra with this system of equations:


$$
\begin{align*}
a + b + c &= 6\\
3a - 2b + c &= 2\\
2a + b  - c &= 1
\end{align*}
$$

We described how this system can be rewritten and solved using matrix algebra:

$$
\,
\begin{pmatrix}
1&1&1\\
3&-2&1\\
2&1&-1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a\\
b\\
c
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
6\\
2\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
\implies
\begin{pmatrix}
a\\
b\\
c
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
1&1&1\\
3&-2&1\\
2&1&-1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{pmatrix}
6\\
2\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Having described matrix notation, we will explain the operation we perform with them. For example, above we have matrix multiplication and we also have a symbol representing the inverse of a matrix. The importance of these operations and others will become clear once we present specific examples related to data analysis.
 

#### Multiplying by a scalar

We start with one of the simplest operations: scalar multiplication. If $a$ is scalar and $\mathbf{X}$ is a matrix, then:


$$
\mathbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix}
  x_{1,1}&\dots & x_{1,p} \\
  x_{2,1}&\dots & x_{2,p} \\
   & \vdots & \\
  x_{N,1}&\dots & x_{N,p} 
  \end{pmatrix} \implies
a \mathbf{X} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
  a x_{1,1} & \dots & a x_{1,p}\\
  a x_{2,1}&\dots & a x_{2,p} \\
  & \vdots & \\
  a x_{N,1} & \dots & a  x_{N,p}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

R automatically follows this rule when we multiply a number by a matrix using `*`:

```{r}
X <- matrix(1:12,4,3)
print(X)
a <- 2
print(a*X)
```


#### The transpose

The transpose is an operation that simply changes columns to rows. We use a $\top$ to denote a transpose. The technical definition is as follows: if X is as we defined it above, here is the transpose which will be $p\times N$:


$$
\mathbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix}
  x_{1,1}&\dots & x_{1,p} \\
  x_{2,1}&\dots & x_{2,p} \\
   & \vdots & \\
  x_{N,1}&\dots & x_{N,p} 
  \end{pmatrix} \implies
\mathbf{X}^\top = \begin{pmatrix}
  x_{1,1}&\dots & x_{p,1} \\
  x_{1,2}&\dots & x_{p,2} \\
   & \vdots & \\
  x_{1,N}&\dots & x_{p,N} 
  \end{pmatrix}
$$

In R we simply use `t`:

```{r}
X <- matrix(1:12,4,3)
X
t(X)
```

#### Matrix multiplication

We start by describing the matrix multiplication shown in the original system of equations example:

$$
\begin{align*}
a + b + c &=6\\
3a - 2b + c &= 2\\
2a + b  - c &= 1
\end{align*}
$$

What we are doing is multiplying the rows of the first matrix by the columns of the second. Since the second matrix only has one column, we perform this multiplication by doing the following:

$$
\,
\begin{pmatrix}
1&1&1\\
3&-2&1\\
2&1&-1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a\\
b\\
c
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
a + b + c \\
3a - 2b + c \\
2a + b  - c 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Here is a simple example. We can check to see if `abc=c(3,2,1)` is a solution:

```{r}
X  <- matrix(c(1,3,2,1,-2,1,1,1,-1),3,3)
abc <- c(3,2,1) #use as an example
rbind( sum(X[1,]*abc), sum(X[2,]*abc), sum(X[3,]*abc))
```

We can use the `%*%` to perform the matrix multiplication and make this much more compact:

```{r}
X%*%abc
```


We can see that `c(3,2,1)` is not a solution as the answer here is not the required `c(6,2,1)`.

To get the solution, we will need to invert the matrix on the left, a concept we learn about below.

Here is the general definition of matrix multiplication of matrices $A$ and $X$:

$$
\mathbf{AX} = \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \dots & a_{1,N}\\
  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \dots & a_{2,N}\\
  & & \vdots & \\
  a_{M,1} & a_{M,2} & \dots & a_{M,N}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  x_{1,1}&\dots & x_{1,p} \\
  x_{2,1}&\dots & x_{2,p} \\
   & \vdots & \\
  x_{N,1}&\dots & x_{N,p} 
  \end{pmatrix}
$$
  
$$  = \begin{pmatrix}
  \sum_{i=1}^N a_{1,i} x_{i,1} & \dots & \sum_{i=1}^N a_{1,i} x_{i,p}\\
  & \vdots & \\
  \sum_{i=1}^N a_{M,i} x_{i,1} & \dots & \sum_{i=1}^N a_{M,i} x_{i,p}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

You can only take the product if the number of columns of the first matrix $A$ equals the number of rows of the second one $X$. Also, the final matrix has the same row numbers as the first $A$ and the same column numbers as the second $X$. 
After you study the example below, you may want to come back and re-read the sections above.

#### The identity matrix

The identity matrix is analogous to the number 1: if you multiply the identity matrix by another matrix, you get the same matrix. For this to happen, we need it to be like this:

$$
\mathbf{I} = \begin{pmatrix}
1&0&0&\dots&0&0\\
0&1&0&\dots&0&0\\
0&0&1&\dots&0&0\\
\vdots &\vdots & \vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\vdots\\
0&0&0&\dots&1&0\\
0&0&0&\dots&0&1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

By this definition, the identity always has to have the same number of rows as columns or be what we call a square matrix.

If you follow the matrix multiplication rule above, you notice this works out:

$$
\mathbf{XI} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
   x_{1,1} & \dots &  x_{1,p}\\
  & \vdots & \\
   x_{N,1} & \dots &   x_{N,p}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&0&0&\dots&0&0\\
0&1&0&\dots&0&0\\
0&0&1&\dots&0&0\\
 & & &\vdots& &\\
0&0&0&\dots&1&0\\
0&0&0&\dots&0&1
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
   x_{1,1} & \dots &  x_{1,p}\\
  & \vdots & \\
   x_{N,1} & \dots & x_{N,p}
\end{pmatrix}
$$


In R you can form an identity matrix this way:
```{r}
n <- 5 #pick dimensions
diag(n)
```

#### The inverse

The inverse of matrix $X$, denoted with $X^{-1}$, has the property that, when multiplied, gives you the identity $X^{-1}X=I$. Of course, not all matrices have inverses. For example, a $2\times 2$ matrix with 1s in all its entries does not have an inverse. 

As we will see when we get to the section on applications to linear models, being able to compute the inverse of a matrix is quite useful. A very convenient aspect of R is that it includes a predefined function `solve` to do this. Here is how we would use it to solve the linear of equations:

```{r}
X <- matrix(c(1,3,2,1,-2,1,1,1,-1),3,3)
y <- matrix(c(6,2,1),3,1)
solve(X)%*%y #equivalent to solve(X,y)
```

Please note that `solve` is a function that should be used with caution as it is not generally numerically stable. We explain this in much more detail in the QR factorization section.
